SwagScanner is a device that can scan your small/medium-sized objects into the virtual world. The system is designed and built from the ground up. I designed the software pipeline to be extensible, robust, and fast. SwagScanner is compatible with any depth camera--just verify its minimum scanning distance and acquire the correct mounting hardware and API and you're good to go. You can find more information about the design process and challenges on [my website](https://www.seanngpack.com/swagscanner/).

## Getting Started

Swag Scanner has two codebases: one in python and one in c++. The python base located in the /python branch is built 
out to perform basic working scanning functionality. The c++ branch is currently in development and aims
to greatly increase performance and results.
